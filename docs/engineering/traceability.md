# Requirements ↔ Module ↔ Feature ↔ Code ↔ Tests

## Coverage rules
`UseCase → feature_id → module_id → contract_ids → source_paths → test_paths → evidence/PR`.
- `source_paths: []` = not mapped yet, **not implemented**.
- Mỗi implemented/verified feature phải có ≥1 source, ≥1 test và evidence; manual exceptions require owner approval.
- Incident/regression maps back to feature. Architectural change maps to ADR and affected features.

## Initial cross-reference

| UC-003 | FEAT-REL-001 | MOD-REL | message-envelope.md | proposed/unmapped |
| UC-004 | FEAT-APR-001 | MOD-APR | permissions.md | proposed/unmapped |

## File mapping after source exists
Set feature frontmatter `source_paths` and `test_paths` to actual repository-relative paths verified through `git ls-files`, then add `evidence` link in spec. The checker can validate existence in strict mode; review still validates semantic traceability.
